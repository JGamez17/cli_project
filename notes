classes 

API class
    GET requests
    initial requests will list got_characters
    iterate list and calling got_characters.new to instantiate new characters

CLI class- handles all input and output
    puts "Winter is coming, choose your house"
    first call API class to get got_house (Api.get_houses)
    Api.get_houses is in CLI class and not main so houses do not keep getting instantiated 
    list houses
    exit point- "Would you like to search again ?"

characters class
    create and save got_characters objects
    got_characters will be instantiated with name and book
