## GOT_CLI 
 
The *GOT_CLI* list **10** houses from HBOs hit TV show Game of Thrones. In this CLI the API class will make one call to (https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses/?"name"). Once the user has selected a house, the user will be able to see the houses region and coat of arms. As one of my favorite shows it became my inspiration for my first CLI project.
